					&ensp;My name is Daniel Arpide and I'm a graduate of Wentworth
					Institute of Technology with a degree in Computer Engineering. While
					having a curriculum based in both Computer Science and computer
					hardware, I have always had a stronger interest in the Computer
					Science side of the courses. In college the largest project I was a
					part of was when I worked with a team to develop an application using
					the Spotify API, while creating this I found out that programming was
					the path I wanted to take in my career. Currently junior software
					engineer focusing in web development.
